## 👤 About Me

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm an aspiring data analyst with a foundation in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. This is a space where I document my ongoing journey in learning data analysis, focusing mainly on SQL. The content here consists primarily of practice queries, exercises, and personal projects that help me develop my skills in working with data.

<h3><strong>What You'll Find Here</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SQL Queries:</strong> A collection of SQL queries I have written while practicing and learning. These cover a variety of topics from basic to more advanced concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Projects:</strong> Small, personal projects to explore different aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, data manipulation, and analysis using SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Resources:</strong> Links to helpful tutorials and resources that I’ve used in my learning process.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Share This?</strong></h3>
<p>This repository is intended to serve as both a record of my progress and a way to share my learning journey with others. As I continue to develop my skills, I will add new content, improve my previous work, and refine my approach to data analysis.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s Coming Next?</strong></h3>
More complex queries and projects as I dive deeper into the field.
Experimentation with different databases and tools.
Improved data visualization techniques and other analytical methods.
<p></p>Feel free to explore, and if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, I would love to hear from you!</p>
